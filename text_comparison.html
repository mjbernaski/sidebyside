                <p>Trump Is Breaking American Intelligence<br>Politicizing the System Makes Dangerous Failures More Likely<br>BY DAVID V. GIOE AND MICHAEL V. HAYDEN<br>July 2, 2025<br>DAVID V. GIOE is British Academy Global Professor of Intelligence and International Security at King’s College London and a former CIA analyst and operations officer.<br>MICHAEL V. HAYDEN is a retired U.S. Air Force general who served as Director of the National Security Agency from 1999 to 2005 and Director of the CIA from 2006 to 2009.<br>“Speak plainly!” Russian President Vladimir Putin snapped at his foreign intelligence chief, Sergei Naryshkin, at a televised security council meeting on the eve of his shambolic full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Naryshkin was visibly nervous. Once he had finally stammered out his support for recognizing the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states—the words Putin was waiting for—he was abruptly told to sit down, like an unprepared pupil flubbing an oral exam. Naryshkin’s apparent ambivalence about embracing Putin’s pretext for the war was likely due to the lack of solid intelligence that Putin’s “special military operation” would return Kyiv to Moscow’s imperial orbit. But rather than air any misgivings, Naryshkin chose compliance and conformity. The intelligence may have been hazy, but the risks of contradicting Putin were clear.</p>
                <p>Putin’s unwavering belief that Ukraine would swiftly capitulate represents the greatest intelligence failure of his quarter-century tenure in power. He was furious when his invasion did not unfold as he envisioned, casting blame on and even arresting some senior security officials. But Putin had laid his own trap. Like many authoritarians, he had fostered conditions in which subordinates told him only what he wanted to hear. Intelligence, in its best form, encourages political leaders to ask the right questions, challenge their assumptions, and consider what might go wrong. Although intelligence officers have a professional responsibility to adapt to the interests, foreign policy priorities, and preferred briefing style of the leaders they serve, sometimes the highest form of service an intelligence agency can provide is to disabuse its political masters of a strongly held but false idea.</p>
                <p>The United States possesses an intelligence community that is the envy of the world. But under President Donald Trump, some of the same pathologies that make authoritarian regimes prone to intelligence failures are making the U.S. system similarly vulnerable. His populist, personalist style has led him to disregard the value of intelligence and abuse the agencies that produce it. In late June, the day before he sent U.S. bombers to strike Iranian nuclear facilities, Trump dismissed Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard’s congressional testimony that Iran was not close to developing a nuclear weapon—an assessment that conflicted with the president’s own claims. “I don’t care what she says,” Trump said. After the U.S. strikes, he triumphantly declared that the targeted Iranian nuclear sites were “completely and totally obliterated,” whereas a preliminary Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) report made a more conservative estimation of the damage.</p>
                <p>The problem is not just that Trump himself belittles intelligence. His administration is also creating conditions in which senior officials tailor their assessments to please him. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth repeated Trump’s hyperbolic claims of obliteration, brushing aside his own intelligence agency’s report. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said the “alleged ‘assessment’ is flat-out wrong.” Gabbard and John Ratcliffe, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, quickly claimed to find “new intelligence” to support Trump’s interpretation of events but declined to share it publicly.</p>
                <p>Increasingly staffed by loyalists rather than seasoned professionals—one critical counterterrorism office in the Department of Homeland Security suddenly found itself under the command of a recent university graduate with no national security experience—intelligence agencies risk becoming overly politicized, providing justification for policy decisions rather than informing them. Meanwhile, the United States faces serious national security threats, not least a heightened terrorism threat as Iranian-backed groups seek retaliation for the United States’ strikes on Iran. Whether it results in a terrorist or cyber attack, a foreign policy miscalculation, or a military surprise, the consequences of an intelligence failure could be profound. And the risk is only growing.</p>
                <p>HEAR NO EVIL<br>Intelligence failures are inevitable even in healthy systems. Uncovering and properly assessing secrets is hard at the best of times; human fallibility guarantees that there will be errors in process and analysis. But distortions within the system increase the likelihood of failure. The classic case is an authoritarian regime in which the self-assured ruler does not tolerate other views. Intelligence officers in such systems operate in an environment where speaking truth to power is not tolerated, acquiescence is preferred over expertise, sycophancy trumps insight, and “alternative facts” must be presented to maintain the leader’s preferred narrative. Offering good-faith assessments that contradict the ruler’s views is considered disloyalty and invites punishment. Without space for analytical dissent and the presentation of unvarnished views, leaders can receive and act on faulty intelligence, as the hapless Naryshkin could attest.</p>
                <p>The United States today faces a similar risk. Trump’s populism is characterized by deep skepticism toward credentialed authority and an intolerance of experts who present inconvenient facts or analysis that challenge his movement’s core beliefs. As authoritarian leaders do, Trump has surrounded himself with loyalists who pass ideological litmus tests, such as by insisting that the 2020 election was “stolen” from Trump. The resulting culture of politicized analysis, self-censorship, and suppression of unwelcome truths mirrors the conditions in autocracies that generate intelligence failure.</p>
                <p>The most important qualification to serve Trump is personal loyalty, not competence or relevant experience. Of course, a U.S. president should be able to expect a degree of loyalty from federal employees. But the expectations of the Trump administration place personal allegiance above the truth. Several long-serving professionals have been asked who they voted for as a prerequisite for traditionally apolitical national security positions—a kind of loyalty test that disqualifies capable officers and sends a message to those who remain that continued service means compliance.</p>
                <p>Loyal senior intelligence officials serving a populist or an autocrat will often tailor their agencies’ activities on the basis of what the leader may or may not want to hear. This can cause intelligence resources to be directed away from actual threats. As director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, for instance, Kash Patel has reorganized the agency to divert special agents and analysts toward immigration enforcement and the reduction of violent crime, leaving investigations into threats with more serious national security implications—counterterrorism, cybercrime, Chinese or Russian intelligence activity in the United States—underresourced. Although curtailing violent crime is a laudable goal, protecting U.S. national security requires that the FBI and other agencies manage a far wider array of risks.</p>
                <p>This is not the only example of the Trump administration’s sidelining or shuttering intelligence units that focus on foreign malign influence operations, nor is it the only redirection of resources away from serious threats to serve political interests. In early May, Gabbard directed U.S. intelligence agencies to increase their intelligence collection in Greenland, specifically to assess the strength of the island’s independence movement. Greenland, an autonomous territory of a NATO ally, is not a security threat to the United States; the reason for gathering such intelligence is to support Trump’s proposal that the United States annex the island. Intelligence agencies do not have unlimited bandwidth. If they are wasting valuable resources on nonexistent threats or dubious schemes to take control of other countries’ territories, they are more likely to be surprised by the plans and intentions of adversaries such as China, Iran, and Russia.</p>
                <p>AIMING TO PLEASE<br>Politicians are always tempted to strip out caveats, overstate analytical confidence levels, or downplay dissenting views, as Trump did when he dismissed as “inconclusive” the DIA’s initial report on damage to the Iranian nuclear program. His is not the first U.S. administration to prefer intelligence that fits around a particular policy narrative. In the late 1960s, frustrated with the United States’ lack of progress during the Vietnam War, President Lyndon Johnson preferred the Pentagon’s rosier assessments of the war’s trajectory to the CIA’s more pessimistic views—which distorted his understanding of the war and caused him to hold out false hope for a failing escalation strategy. And in 2002, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld set up the Office of Special Plans in the Pentagon to establish a link between Iraq and al-Qaeda—a connection the CIA did not find credible—to support the case for a U.S. invasion of Iraq.</p>
                <p>In both cases, cherry-picking intelligence led U.S. presidents toward strategic failure. But the lessons of history have apparently been lost in the present White House. In May, Gabbard fired the acting chair of the National Intelligence Council and his deputy after they assessed that the Venezuelan-based criminal group Tren de Aragua was not controlled by the Venezuelan government, contrary to the claim the Trump administration has used to justify its deportation of Venezuelans. When they first reached this conclusion, Gabbard’s chief of staff, a Trump loyalist, asked the council to “relook” at the evidence and “do some rewriting” so that the assessment would not be “used against” Gabbard or Trump—a nakedly political request. The NIC leaders broadly maintained their initial judgment rather than amend their assessment to suit the president’s policy, and it cost them their jobs.</p>
                <p>It is easy to foresee how firing intelligence officials for making evidence-based assessments could drive those still serving to engage in self-censorship and groupthink, both key ingredients in intelligence failure that are prevalent in autocratic systems. Brave analysts may no longer be willing to stick their heads above the parapet to provide intelligence that Trump needs to know, even if he doesn’t want to hear it. And if the president only receives assessments designed to please him, he will become stuck in his own echo chamber, unable to make fully informed decisions based on hard reality.</p>
                <p>The blatant politicization of intelligence has consequences beyond the halls of the White House. During the dark days of the Bush administration’s clamor for war in Iraq, the U.S. intelligence community lost credibility not only with the American people but also with partners abroad. The same corrosion of civic trust and falling confidence of allies is underway today. If the United States’ allies and partners consider U.S. intelligence untrustworthy or worry that their own intelligence may become politicized, they may choose to share less with Washington, which could rob U.S. intelligence agencies of a vital clue they may need to foil a plot or understand a key development. Cooperation with foreign agencies is a central part of U.S. intelligence gathering. Washington itself has enormous capabilities, but it cannot replace the collection and analysis provided by its partners.</p>
                <p>SHOOT THE MESSENGER<br>While publicly claiming that its actions are meant to depoliticize U.S. intelligence agencies, the Trump administration has in fact politicized them further by pressuring them to produce assessments that reinforce preferred policy narratives, dismissing assessments that don’t, purging staff members who are perceived to be disloyal, and harassing the workforce through methods such as random polygraph tests conducted under the guise of leak investigations. It is clear to members of the civil service that their positions are subject to the administration’s whims. Like the NIC leaders, they could be fired for simply doing their jobs. Like staff members working in diversity, equity, and inclusion offices, they could be fired for doing a job the administration did not want done. Like six National Security Council staffers who were let go after Trump met with the far-right activist Laura Loomer, they could be fired for perceived disloyalty. Or, like the director and deputy director of the National Security Agency, they could be fired for no stated reason at all.</p>
                <p>Administrative chaos masquerading as cost-cutting has sapped morale. In March, Trump’s adviser Elon Musk and staffers at his so-called Department of Government Efficiency visited the CIA and the NSA headquarters, sending shivers down the spines of career professionals. Shortly afterward, both agencies announced thousands of job cuts, mostly in the form of rescinded job offers, layoffs of new hires, routine retirements, and voluntary buyouts. The buyout offer enticed several senior intelligence officers out of public service, although many stated privately that the offer only made the difficult decision to resign easier to swallow. Not only does their premature departure deprive the administration of their expertise and experience, but the cancellation of job offers means they will not be replaced by promising young officers brimming with passion and patriotism.</p>
                <p>Ideally, intelligence agencies should welcome and harness talent from all corners. Narrowing the talent pool robs the country of the opportunity to tap the full potential of its citizens, undermining the potential contributions of intelligence to statecraft. In the Soviet Union, only Communist Party members were permitted to join the primary intelligence agency, the KGB. That commitment to Marxist-Leninist ideological purity damaged the KGB’s analytical performance: the agency routinely underestimated the resilience of Western cohesion and overestimated the strength of Soviet client states and revolutionary movements. During World War II, British intelligence benefited from Alan Turing’s codebreaking genius in part because he kept his homosexuality hidden. Unfortunately, the Trump administration is repelling talent by making it clear that it no longer values diverse perspectives in U.S. intelligence agencies. Instead of simply reassigning officers who had had been temporarily detailed to work on DEI initiatives in the CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the administration fired them when those initiatives were shut down, sending the message that it expects ideological conformity.</p>
                <p>A U.S. intelligence community that increasingly operates like that of an autocratic country will struggle to retain employees and recruit new ones. At the moment, public service may not look appealing to America’s best and brightest. Worse, the current workforce is demoralized and distracted by the purges and the abuse of the system that they witness. Thousands of intelligence officers are tapping their professional networks and getting their secret resumes cleared so that they can apply for private-sector jobs. A nervous and preoccupied workforce will hardly deliver peak performance.</p>
                <p>The Trump administration’s proximity to conspiracy theorizing also corrodes its relationship to intelligence. Loomer, whose meeting with Trump prompted several high-profile intelligence agency firings, is known for promoting conspiracy theories, including the unsubstantiated claim that the 9/11 attacks were an “inside job.” Other members of the Trump administration, such as Dan Bongino, the deputy FBI director, have openly floated conspiracy theories accusing the “deep state” of withholding the truth from the American people on every topic from the prison death of the criminal defendant Jeffrey Epstein to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. No genuine conspiracies have been uncovered, but the vilification of U.S. intelligence agencies deemed part of the “deep state” has a lasting effect on the perceived legitimacy of the work they do.</p>
                <p>Demonizing intelligence ultimately makes the United States less safe. Intelligence agencies need the support of the public if they are to do their jobs well. Federal law enforcement, for instance, relies on tips from citizens; repeatedly calling the FBI “irredeemably corrupt”—in the words of its deputy director—may dissuade people from cooperating when approached by special agents. And if Trump-aligned media outlets are spouting populist rhetoric about the threat from within—specifically, the threat that federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies pose to civil liberties—politicians may find it difficult to support legislation that enables necessary intelligence gathering. Early last year, when it came time to reauthorize Section 702 of a 2008 amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a key provision that permits the U.S. government to surveil foreign citizens outside the United States, the same people who are now leading the FBI joined far-right media outlets to misleadingly paint the law as providing Orwellian power to an unaccountable deep state. The provision was eventually renewed for two more years, but the episode illustrated the vulnerability of intelligence agencies’ most valuable tools to exaggerated political rhetoric.</p>
                <p>THE SHAPE OF FAILURE<br>Trump is not a born intelligence consumer. Judging by the infrequency of his briefings in this area—his public schedule has not included more than one per week, in contrast to the six per week that his predecessors typically received—he seems uninterested in the advantages good intelligence can confer. He operates on instinct and often justifies his polices as “common sense,” which is the sort of populist heuristic approach that does not align with the methodical process of intelligence analysts. Trump prefers slogans over substance, narrative over nuance, and conspiracy over curiosity. He avoids digging into details. His ideological positions run headlong into empiricism, as the administration’s fight with economists over the effects of its tariff policy has shown. Trump seems to value intelligence only when it validates his own instinct; he does not look to it to challenge his beliefs or to help him consider different angles.</p>
                <p>The way the Trump administration is managing the U.S. intelligence system increases the likelihood of an intelligence failure. It could take the form of a surprise attack, a misreading of an adversary, or an inability to anticipate another consequential event. Trump has ignored warnings before. During his first term, he was slow to respond to alerts about the spread of COVID-19, hindering the United States’ early pandemic response, and he was dismissive of the security risks of aggressive homegrown nativism presented to him by intelligence analysts at the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security in the lead-up to the storming of the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.</p>
                <p>Something similar could happen today. Warnings, repeatedly dismissed with prejudice, may eventually stop arriving. Intelligence may fail because critical information may not reach Trump. Fear of retribution could cause officials to self-censor or avoid providing assessments that may provoke an ideologically motivated backlash, such as alerts about domestic violent extremism among far-right groups or about Russian information operations. As the former senior CIA analyst Brian O’Neill wrote in Just Security last month, “the next intelligence failure will not be a surprise. It will be a choice.”</p>
                <p>An intelligence failure on his watch may not compel Trump to fix the problems that caused it. Instead, he could blame U.S. intelligence agencies for falling down on the job or even falsely suggest that they were always out to get him. Any reform his administration introduced after an intelligence failure would likely be designed to further politicize the intelligence community, weaken its independence, and give the executive branch greater control of its budgets, personnel, and authorities.</p>
                <p>A talented sports team coached badly can still squeak out a win. If the United States avoids a major intelligence failure in the next few years, it will be thanks to the enduring professional ethos of its intelligence agencies. But those agencies will not be reaching their highest potential; if they are consistently misused, ignored, and politicized, they will not be able to produce the information advantage that the intelligence community was designed to deliver to the U.S. president. Trump is enamored of the United States’ natural resources—its oil and natural gas, its timber, its agriculture. The country’s unparalleled intelligence community is another precious resource, a pillar of the “greatness” Trump strives for. Ensuring American security today and for future generations depends on his good stewardship of this national treasure.</p>

                <p>Thought for 10s<br>Hello! I&#x27;m your AI tutor here to help you build a strong, logical rebuttal to the Foreign Affairs article you&#x27;ve chosen. Since you&#x27;ve already read the piece (as per the assignment), let&#x27;s start by confirming the key points to ensure we&#x27;re on the same page. This will serve as the foundation for crafting your rebuttal.</p>
                <p>Could you please share:</p>
                <p>The title and author of the article?<br>A brief summary of what you see as its main thesis or central argument?<br>3-5 key supporting points or evidence the author uses to back it up?<br>Once you provide that, I can help refine or confirm those points, and then we&#x27;ll move into developing your rebuttal step by step—starting with challenging the core argument, followed by addressing the supporting ones. Sound good?</p>
                <p>Here is the article.</p>
                <p>trumpintelligence.txt</p>
                <p>Thought for 18s<br>Thanks for sharing the full article! I&#x27;ve reviewed it carefully to ensure we&#x27;re aligned on its content. Since you&#x27;ve read it as per the assignment, I&#x27;ll start by summarizing and confirming the key points based on what&#x27;s presented. This will give us a solid foundation before we dive into building your rebuttal.</p>
                <p>Confirmed Key Points of the Article<br>Title and Authors: &quot;Trump Is Breaking American Intelligence: Politicizing the System Makes Dangerous Failures More Likely&quot; by David V. Gioe (former CIA analyst and current professor at King’s College London) and Michael V. Hayden (retired U.S. Air Force general, former NSA and CIA Director).<br>Main Thesis/Central Argument: The U.S. intelligence community, once the world&#x27;s best, is being undermined by President Trump&#x27;s populist and personalist style, which politicizes it in ways similar to authoritarian regimes (e.g., Putin&#x27;s Russia). This increases the risk of intelligence failures by prioritizing loyalty over expertise, suppressing dissent, and redirecting resources, potentially leading to national security threats like terrorism or miscalculations.<br>Key Supporting Points/Evidence:<br>Comparison to Authoritarian Failures: Draws parallels to Putin&#x27;s Ukraine invasion failure, where subordinates avoided contradicting the leader. Argues Trump fosters similar &quot;yes-men&quot; culture, e.g., dismissing DNI Tulsi Gabbard&#x27;s assessment on Iran&#x27;s nuclear program and exaggerating U.S. strike damage, with officials like SecDef Pete Hegseth and CIA Director John Ratcliffe tailoring reports to match Trump&#x27;s claims.<br>Prioritizing Loyalty Over Competence: Appointments based on ideological tests (e.g., belief in 2020 election fraud) rather than experience, such as Kash Patel at FBI redirecting resources from counterterrorism to immigration/violent crime, or gathering intel on Greenland for annexation. Also, firing NIC leaders for contradicting claims about Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.<br>Politicization and Self-Censorship: Examples include pressuring agencies to alter assessments (e.g., on Iran damage or Venezuela), purging disloyal staff (e.g., after meetings with Laura Loomer), job cuts via Elon Musk&#x27;s efficiency department, and shutting DEI initiatives, leading to low morale, talent loss, and groupthink.<br>Broader Consequences: Erodes public trust, ally cooperation, and recruitment; aligns with conspiracy theories (e.g., from Dan Bongino); Trump consumes little intelligence (one briefing/week vs. predecessors&#x27; six), relying on instinct over analysis. Historical parallels to Vietnam and Iraq wars show cherry-picking leads to failure; warns of potential surprises like ignored warnings on COVID or Jan. 6.<br>Overall Risk: Even if no immediate failure occurs, the system is weakened, making the U.S. less safe long-term.<br>Does this match your understanding? If anything feels off or if you want to add/revise a point, let me know—we can tweak it before proceeding.</p>
                <p>Developing Your Rebuttal Piecemeal<br>Now, let&#x27;s build your rebuttal step by step. A strong rebuttal should directly challenge the article&#x27;s thesis with logical counterarguments, evidence, and alternative interpretations, while maintaining clarity and objectivity. We&#x27;ll start with the core argument (Trump&#x27;s politicization mirrors authoritarianism and heightens failure risk), then move to supporting points. Aim for concise, evidence-based counters that could fit into a 500-word essay.</p>
                <p>Step 1: Challenging the Core Argument<br>The article&#x27;s heart is that Trump&#x27;s approach creates authoritarian-like vulnerabilities in U.S. intelligence, leading to inevitable failures. To rebut this, we need to argue that these changes strengthen rather than weaken the system, or that the criticisms are exaggerated/partisan. Possible angles:</p>
                <p>Trump&#x27;s reforms address real inefficiencies or biases in intelligence (e.g., past failures like Iraq WMD or Russiagate were due to entrenched bureaucracy, not politicization).<br>Unlike true authoritarians, the U.S. has checks (Congress, media, courts) preventing total control.<br>Evidence from Trump&#x27;s first term shows no major intelligence failures attributable to him; instead, he claims successes like ISIS defeat or Abraham Accords.<br>What are your initial thoughts on countering this core idea? Do you have a preferred angle (e.g., emphasizing accountability or questioning the authors&#x27; biases as former insiders)? Share a draft sentence or two for your rebuttal&#x27;s opening thesis, and I&#x27;ll help refine it with logic and potential evidence.</p>
                <p>Once we nail this, we&#x27;ll tackle the first supporting point (e.g., the Iran example or loyalty appointments). Remember, your final rebuttal needs to be 500 words or less, so keep counters focused!</p>
                <p>I think that there is a possibility the US intelligence apparatus is broken and needs to be repaired.   Trump is cultivating alternatives to the current institution.     This is a deliberate strategy no fix, not break the intelligence capabilities.</p>
                <p>Thought for 35s<br>That&#x27;s a solid angle for your rebuttal—it flips the article&#x27;s narrative by positioning Trump&#x27;s actions as necessary reforms to a flawed system, rather than destructive politicization. This directly challenges the core thesis that Trump&#x27;s style mirrors authoritarianism and invites failure. By emphasizing historical intelligence breakdowns and framing Trump&#x27;s appointments as &quot;cultivating alternatives&quot; for accountability and efficiency, you can argue that the real risk is maintaining the status quo.</p>
                <p>To substantiate this, let&#x27;s draw on some real-world context (based on recent developments up to July 21, 2025). U.S. intelligence has a long track record of failures, which supports your point that it&#x27;s &quot;broken&quot; and needs fixing:</p>
                <p>Major historical lapses include Pearl Harbor (1941, where signals were missed leading to surprise attack), the 9/11 attacks (2001, due to siloed information and ignored warnings), the Iraq WMD misassessment (2003, politicized intel justifying invasion), and more recent ones like the Afghanistan withdrawal chaos (2021) or underestimating Russia&#x27;s Ukraine invasion (2022).foreignpolicy.com+2 more These weren&#x27;t just &quot;inevitable errors&quot; as the article claims; they often stemmed from bureaucratic groupthink, over-reliance on unvetted sources, or alignment with political agendas—issues Trump&#x27;s reforms aim to address.<br>On Trump&#x27;s strategy: His 2025 appointments (e.g., Tulsi Gabbard as DNI, Pete Hegseth as SecDef, Kash Patel at FBI, John Ratcliffe at CIA) are described in recent analyses as a &quot;moment to reform&quot; the intelligence community, prioritizing loyalty to American interests over entrenched elites.iiss.orgm.economictimes.com For instance, Gabbard has pushed for declassifying files on past politicized intel (like the Trump-Russia narrative) and criminal referrals for abuses, which aligns with fixing systemic biases rather than breaking the system.@DonnaSlaybaugh Patel&#x27;s FBI redirects (e.g., toward immigration enforcement) are framed by supporters as reallocating resources from low-impact areas to high-priority threats like border security, not sidelining real dangers.<br>Drafting Your Rebuttal&#x27;s Opening Thesis<br>Let&#x27;s build this piecemeal. Start with a clear, concise thesis statement for your essay&#x27;s intro (aim for 1-2 sentences). Here&#x27;s a suggested draft based on your idea—feel free to tweak:</p>
                <p>&quot;While Gioe and Hayden portray President Trump&#x27;s intelligence reforms as authoritarian politicization that risks catastrophic failures, these changes represent a deliberate strategy to repair a long-broken U.S. intelligence apparatus plagued by historical missteps and bureaucratic inertia. By cultivating loyal alternatives focused on accountability and America-first priorities, Trump is enhancing national security, not undermining it.&quot;</p>
                <p>Why this works logically:</p>
                <p>It directly references the authors/article for relevance.<br>Counters the core claim (politicization = breaking) with your flip (reforms = fixing).<br>Sets up supporting arguments (e.g., historical failures, specific appointments).<br>What do you think—does this capture your view? Any changes or additions (e.g., specific examples to include)?</p>
                <p>Next Step: Supporting Arguments<br>Once we lock this in, we&#x27;ll tackle the first supporting point from the article (e.g., the Iran strike dismissal and &quot;tailored&quot; assessments). For that, you could argue: Past administrations (like Bush on Iraq) cherry-picked intel too, but Trump&#x27;s approach demands verifiable facts over &quot;expert&quot; consensus that has failed before. Share your thoughts on a counter for that, and I&#x27;ll help refine with evidence.</p>
                <p>Remember, your final 500-word rebuttal should flow logically: intro thesis → 2-3 body paras challenging key points → conclusion. To assess it later, consider: Does it use evidence effectively? Is the language clear and persuasive? Does it avoid ad hominem attacks on the authors?</p>

                <p>can you help me find more recent examples of intelligence failures?  e.g. WMD in Iraq</p>
                <p>Thought for 65s<br>Sure, I&#x27;d be happy to help gather evidence for your rebuttal by highlighting recent U.S. intelligence failures. The Iraq WMD misassessment in 2003 is a classic example of overreliance on flawed sources and politicized analysis leading to a misguided invasion, but there have been several since then that underscore systemic issues like poor information sharing, underestimation of threats, and bureaucratic silos—issues that predate recent administrations and support the idea that reforms are needed.</p>
                <p>Here are some key examples from the past decade or so, focusing on post-2020 where possible for recency (up to mid-2025). I&#x27;ve drawn from reliable reports, analyses, and investigations:</p>
                <p>Boston Marathon Bombing (2013): U.S. intelligence received warnings from Russia about the Tsarnaev brothers&#x27; radicalization but failed to connect the dots or share info effectively across agencies, leading to the attack that killed three and injured hundreds.domesticpreparedness.com<br>SolarWinds Cyber Breach (2020): Russian hackers infiltrated U.S. government and corporate networks for months undetected, exposing sensitive data; intelligence agencies missed the sophisticated supply-chain attack despite prior cyber warnings.linkedin.com<br>COVID-19 Pandemic Response (2020): Agencies like the CIA and NSA failed to provide timely, actionable warnings on the virus&#x27;s origins and global spread, with early intel downplayed or siloed, contributing to a delayed U.S. response that cost lives and economic damage.jstor.org+4 more<br>Colonial Pipeline Ransomware Attack (2021): Cybercriminals (linked to Russia) shut down a major U.S. fuel pipeline, causing shortages; intelligence failed to anticipate or prevent the disruption despite known vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure.linkedin.com<br>Oldsmar Water Treatment Hack (2021): Hackers remotely accessed a Florida water plant and tried to poison the supply by altering chemical levels; local detection averted disaster, but national intel overlooked rising cyber threats to utilities.linkedin.com<br>January 6 Capitol Riot (2021): FBI and DHS ignored or under-assessed &quot;massive amounts&quot; of open-source intel on violent threats, failing to canvass field offices or share warnings, which enabled the breach despite prior indicators of extremism.hsgac.senate.gov+4 more<br>Afghanistan Withdrawal (2021): Intelligence underestimated the Afghan military&#x27;s collapse speed, predicting months before Taliban takeover; this &quot;massive failure&quot; led to chaos, stranded Americans, and the deaths of 13 U.S. service members in a Kabul bombing.nationalsecurityjournal.nz+4 more<br>Hamas October 7 Attack on Israel (2023): While primarily an Israeli failure, U.S. intel shared some warnings but missed key signs of the assault; critics called it a joint &quot;American intelligence failure&quot; due to overreliance on tech surveillance and underestimation of Hamas capabilities.npr.org+4 more<br>Assassination Attempts on Trump (July and September 2024): Secret Service and FBI failed to implement basic security or share threat info promptly, allowing two attempts; whistleblowers highlighted blocked oversight and slow info release.goldiis.org<br>ISIS-Tied Tajikistan Nationals Arrest (June 2024): Intel missed plotting by eight suspects in major U.S. cities until after entry via the southern border, raising concerns over vetting and border threats.goldiis.org<br>Iran Nuclear Assessment (2025): Agencies provided conflicting reports on Iran&#x27;s program and U.S. strike damage, with initial DIA estimates downplaying impacts, highlighting ongoing issues with accurate threat evaluation.m.economictimes.comeconomist.com<br>These examples show patterns of failures due to groupthink, poor coordination, and sometimes politicization—reinforcing your argument that the intelligence system needs deliberate fixes.

                <p>34 web pages</p>
                <p>how do we know these are intelligence failures?  Perhaps the President and other officials just ignored the intelligence.</p>
                <p>Thought for 39s<br>That&#x27;s a great critical question—it sharpens your rebuttal by ensuring we distinguish between true intelligence failures (where agencies failed to collect, analyze, share, or act on information) and cases where solid intelligence was produced but ignored or overridden by policymakers. Drawing from official reports, congressional investigations, and analyses, many of these examples involve systemic shortcomings in the intelligence community itself, not just leadership disregard. This supports your angle that the U.S. intelligence apparatus has longstanding flaws needing deliberate fixes, like those under Trump.</p>
                <p>To make this clear and useful for your essay, I&#x27;ll break it down by example, citing key evidence on what went wrong. Where possible, I&#x27;ve noted if warnings were ignored, but the focus is on agency-level failures (e.g., poor coordination, analysis biases, or detection gaps) that predate recent reforms.</p>
                <p>Summary Table of Examples and Failure Types<br>Using a table for comparison, as it helps organize data effectively:</p>

This evidence bolsters your thesis: Trump&#x27;s &quot;cultivating alternatives&quot; (e.g., loyal appointees challenging biases) could prevent such lapses. For your rebuttal, pick 3-4 strongest (e.g., Afghanistan, Jan. 6, SolarWinds) to keep under 500 words. Thoughts on integrating this into a draft para?</p>

                <p>this is complicated.  the intelligence may have been considered by officials but not correctly processed.</p>
                <p>Thought for 33s<br>You&#x27;re absolutely right—this is a nuanced area, and distinguishing between intelligence that was ignored outright versus considered but mishandled (e.g., through flawed analysis, poor dissemination, or bureaucratic delays) is key to building a strong, logical rebuttal. Intelligence &quot;processing&quot; failures often occur within the agencies themselves, where raw data is collected but not accurately assessed, prioritized, or shared effectively. This supports your core argument that the U.S. intelligence system has systemic flaws needing deliberate fixes, like Trump&#x27;s emphasis on accountability and alternative perspectives to break groupthink.</p>
                <p>To clarify, intelligence failures can happen at stages like:</p>
                <p>Collection: Missing key data.<br>Analysis/Processing: Misinterpreting or downplaying evidence due to biases, overconfidence, or incomplete integration.<br>Dissemination: Not sharing timely, actionable insights.<br>Policymaker Response: Considering but overriding or delaying action.<br>From recent official reports and analyses, many failures involve processing mishaps within agencies, not just top-level disregard. Below, I&#x27;ve updated our examples with details on processing, using a table for clarity. These draw from congressional reviews, Senate reports, and expert assessments to show how intel was often &quot;considered&quot; but botched in handling.</p>
                <p>Updated Table: Intelligence Failures with Focus on Processing</p>

For a body paragraph draft:</p>
                <p>&quot;Critics like Gioe and Hayden overlook how historical failures stem from flawed intelligence processing within agencies, not just presidential disregard. In the 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal, agencies considered indicators but processed them optimistically, underestimating collapse due to analytic biases.nationalsecurityjournal.nznytimes.com Similarly, for January 6, FBI/DHS collected threats but mishandled assessment, downplaying severity in reports.pbs.orgtandfonline.com Trump&#x27;s reforms, by prioritizing accountability over bureaucracy, address these processing gaps to prevent future surprises.&quot;</p>
                <p>What do you think—want to expand on a specific example or draft more? Next, we can challenge the article&#x27;s supporting point on loyalty appointments.</p>

                <p>it seems like intelligence at the time is different than it looks in retrospect.</p>
                <p>Thought for 40s<br>You&#x27;re spot on—this is a critical nuance in analyzing intelligence failures, often called &quot;hindsight bias&quot; or the &quot;knew-it-all-along&quot; effect. In real-time, intelligence is rarely crystal clear; it&#x27;s pieced together from incomplete, ambiguous, or conflicting data under time pressure, with analysts making judgments based on probabilities rather than certainties. Only after an event do patterns seem obvious, leading critics (like the article&#x27;s authors) to label them as outright &quot;failures&quot; without accounting for the fog of uncertainty at the time. This perspective strengthens your rebuttal by showing that the U.S. intelligence system isn&#x27;t inherently &quot;broken&quot; in a simplistic way but suffers from human and structural limitations that Trump&#x27;s deliberate reforms—such as injecting alternative viewpoints and prioritizing accountability—could mitigate by reducing overconfidence and groupthink.</p>
                <p>Evidence on Hindsight Bias in Key Examples<br>Drawing from recent analyses and discussions, here&#x27;s how hindsight bias plays out in the failures we&#x27;ve discussed. These sources highlight that intel was often considered and processed reasonably given the context, but retrospective scrutiny makes it look negligent:</p>
                <p>Afghanistan Withdrawal (2021): At the time, agencies like the CIA and DIA had data on Taliban advances but processed it through an optimistic lens, assuming Afghan forces would hold longer based on historical patterns and allied assurances. Post-collapse, it seemed like a glaring miss, but real-time assessments were hedged with uncertainties (e.g., variable troop morale). A 2021 ABC News report notes this wasn&#x27;t just ignorance but a failure to weigh low-probability scenarios amid political pressures.abcnews.go.com Similarly, a 2025 X post from a military analyst reflects on how layered factors (e.g., arbitrary deadlines and sugarcoated intel) contributed, but truth-telling deterrents prevented bolder real-time challenges.@infantrydort<br>January 6 Capitol Riot (2021): Warnings from open sources and tips existed, but agencies processed them as non-credible or low-threat based on past events (e.g., protests without violence). Hindsight makes the escalation obvious, but a 2023 Senate report and Guardian analysis emphasize that dissemination failed due to siloed judgments, not total disregard—real-time intel didn&#x27;t scream &quot;imminent attack.&quot;theguardian.comjpost.com An AEI op-ed from 2023 calls it a &quot;surprise&quot; attack in quotes, underscoring how post-event reviews amplify what seemed routine beforehand.aei.org<br>Hamas October 7 Attack (2023): Israeli and U.S. intel had indicators (e.g., Hamas planning documents known for over a year), but they were processed as bluffs or unlikely due to overreliance on tech surveillance and assumptions of deterrence. Retrospectively, it&#x27;s a &quot;massive failure,&quot; but a 2024 CTC West Point assessment and Lawfare article argue officials dismissed them rationally at the time, as similar signals had fizzled before.ctc.westpoint.edulawfaremedia.org A 2025 X post draws parallels to 9/11, where fragmented clues weren&#x27;t connected until after.@NachtObito<br>COVID-19 Pandemic (2020): Early intel on origins and spread was divided (lab leak vs. natural), with agencies processing limited data from China amid global confusion. Hindsight critiques the slow response, but real-time assessments were cautious due to unverifiable sources. A 2025 X post from a podcast host notes the lack of honest post-mortems on bad assumptions, like overestimating containment.@apexguardhq<br>Broader discussions, like a 2025 study cited on X, reveal overconfidence among U.S./NATO officials negates actual knowledge, leading to disasters (e.g., underestimating Russia or Iran)—but calibration training could fix it, aligning with your reform angle.@StarboySAR Historical parallels, such as Iraq WMD (overhyped threats based on cherry-picked data) or Pearl Harbor, show this bias recurring, per a 2021 Jerusalem Post analysis.jpost.com@tobiaschneider</p>
                <p>Incorporating This into Your Rebuttal<br>This adds depth to challenging the article&#x27;s core claim that Trump&#x27;s politicization invites failures like authoritarian ones. Instead, argue that hindsight bias inflates past flaws, but patterns of real-time processing errors (e.g., optimism bias) prove the need for Trump&#x27;s strategy: loyal alternatives who question assumptions without fear of bureaucratic backlash.</p>
                <p>Here&#x27;s a suggested draft paragraph (keep your total essay ~500 words):</p>
                <p>&quot;Gioe and Hayden&#x27;s alarm over Trump&#x27;s reforms ignores hindsight bias, which makes intelligence failures appear more egregious retrospectively than they were in real-time. For instance, in Afghanistan, agencies processed available data optimistically based on allied inputs, not through negligence but amid uncertainty—a pattern seen in January 6, where threats were downplayed as routine.abcnews.go.comtheguardian.com By cultivating appointees focused on accountability, Trump addresses these processing pitfalls, fostering diverse views to challenge groupthink and enhance decision-making under ambiguity.&quot;</p>

                <p>Next Step: Supporting Arguments<br>Let&#x27;s move to rebutting the article&#x27;s first supporting point (comparison to authoritarian failures, e.g., Putin&#x27;s Ukraine miscalculation mirrored in Trump&#x27;s Iran strike dismissal). A counter could be: Unlike Putin&#x27;s echo chamber, Trump&#x27;s approach demands verifiable intel over consensus, as seen in declassifying past abuses (e.g., Russia probe).

This submission includes the AI&#x27;s instructions on how to copy, format, and submit the assignment, as well as a partial sample draft of the rebuttal essay itself.</p>
                <p>This is a valuable submission as it provides a perfectly clear window into the student&#x27;s process. Here is my evaluation based on the framework I outlined previously.</p>
                <p>---</p>
                <p>### **Evaluation of Student Submission**</p>
                <p>#### **Part A: Evaluating the Rebuttal Essay**</p>
                <p>The submission does not contain a completed 500-word essay. Instead, it includes a ~200-word partial draft generated by the AI. I will evaluate this draft as an indicator of the final product&#x27;s likely quality.</p>
                <p>* **Thesis and Argument Clarity:** The draft presents a clear thesis: &quot;Trump’s deliberate strategy repairs a U.S. intelligence system long plagued by processing errors and hindsight-inflated failures, enhancing accountability to better serve American interests.&quot; This is a strong, debatable claim that directly rebuts the likely premise of the source article. **(Strength: High)**<br>* **Evidence and Support:** The draft mentions the fall of Afghanistan, the January 6th Capitol attack, and the SolarWinds hack as examples of intelligence failures. However, it *asserts* a connection between these events and the supposed benefits of Trump&#x27;s reforms without providing any actual evidence or logical bridge to prove the connection. For instance, how did appointing Kash Patel specifically address the type of failure seen in the SolarWinds attack? The evidence is named but not analyzed. **(Strength: Low)**<br>* **Analysis and Critical Thinking:** The analysis is superficial. It uses terms like &quot;hindsight bias&quot; and &quot;bureaucratic groupthink,&quot; which were likely suggested by the AI, but it does not explore these concepts in any depth. The argument is a collection of assertions rather than a developed analytical case. **(Strength: Very Low)**<br>* **Prose and Mechanics:** The writing is grammatically correct and clear. However, it lacks an authentic authorial voice and reads like generic, confident AI-generated text. The sentence structure and vocabulary are polished but without nuance. **(Strength: Moderate, but not the student&#x27;s own)**</p>
                <p>**Conclusion for Part A:** The essay component is incomplete and substantively weak. It presents a thesis but fails to support it with meaningful analysis or evidence, relying instead on high-level assertions. **Grade: D (as a draft)**</p>
                <p>---</p>
                <p>#### **Part B: Evaluating the Use of AI**</p>
                <p>The student submitted the entire AI conversation log, which makes this portion of the evaluation straightforward.</p>
                <p>* **Transparency and Honesty:** The student was perfectly transparent by submitting the raw output. While this likely reveals a misunderstanding of the assignment, they did not attempt to hide their methodology. **(Grade: A for Transparency)**<br>* **Intellectual Labor and Prompt Crafting:** The AI&#x27;s response indicates the student&#x27;s prompts were of very low effort. The AI states, &quot;to use the outline you requested,&quot; &quot;the sample rebuttal paragraph,&quot; and &quot;to assess your rebuttal (as requested earlier).&quot; This shows the student asked the AI to perform all core intellectual tasks: outlining, writing sample paragraphs, and even formulating the criteria for self-assessment. The student outsourced the thinking behind the assignment&#x27;s structure. **(Grade: F)**<br>* **Critical Engagement vs. &quot;Copy-Paste&quot;:** There is zero evidence of critical engagement. The student has submitted the AI&#x27;s sample text as their own work. More telling is that the AI&#x27;s instructions include a warning to the student to remove the AI&#x27;s internal citation code (e.g., `&lt;grok:render type=&quot;render_inline_citation&quot;&gt;`), which demonstrates the student did not even perform a basic &quot;clean-up&quot; edit of the AI&#x27;s text. This is a pure &quot;copy-paste&quot; approach. **(Grade: F)**<br>* **Ethical Boundaries:** The student used the AI not as a tool but as a ghostwriter. The AI was tasked with generating the core components of the argument and the text itself. This fundamentally misunderstands the assignment&#x27;s goal, which is to use AI to *assist* and *challenge* one&#x27;s own thinking, not replace it. **(Grade: F)**</p>
                <p>**Conclusion for Part B:** The student demonstrated a profound misunderstanding of how to use AI as an academic tool. The process shows a complete reliance on the AI for all cognitive labor, from structuring to writing.</p>
                <p>---</p>
                <p>### **Overall Assessment and Recommendations**</p>
                <p>This submission represents a &quot;teachable moment.&quot; The student has not successfully completed the assignment, but their submission is a perfect illustration of the pitfalls of using AI uncritically.</p>
                <p>**Primary Issue:** The student asked the AI to do the work *for* them, rather than using the AI to help them do the work *better*. They outsourced the critical thinking, the structuring, the writing, and even the process of submission.</p>
                <p>**Recommendations for the Student:**</p>
                <p>1.  **Reread the Assignment&#x27;s Goal:** The objective is to write a rebuttal. This requires you to have an opinion and to defend it. The AI can&#x27;t have an opinion for you, but it can help you strengthen yours.<br>2.  **Start with Your Own Brain:** Read the *Foreign Affairs* article. Put it aside. On a blank piece of paper, write down what you think. What was the author&#x27;s main point? Why do you disagree with it? What are three reasons for your disagreement? This is *your* core argument.<br>3.  **Use AI Strategically:** Now, engage the AI.<br>    * **Good Prompt:** &quot;Here is my thesis: [Your thesis]. Can you act as a devil&#x27;s advocate and provide three potential counterarguments to my position?&quot;<br>    * **Good Prompt:** &quot;I am using the 2021 fall of Afghanistan as evidence. Can you help me find a report or article that details the specific intelligence failures leading up to it?&quot;<br>    * **Good Prompt:** &quot;I wrote this paragraph. Can you suggest ways to make the connection between my evidence and my main point clearer?&quot;<br>4.  **Write in Your Own Voice:** Your final essay must be written by you. The AI&#x27;s text should serve as inspiration or information, not as the final product. Your submission should be a document you wrote, with a *separate* AI log showing how you used the tool to get there.</p>
                <p>This student should be asked to redo the assignment from scratch, using these recommendations to guide their process. They have demonstrated the ability to use AI, but now they must learn to use it effectively and ethically.</p>
